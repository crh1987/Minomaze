    <h2 class="descriptor">Description:</h2>
    <p>This project is trying to educationally gamify Visibility Graphs working with common shortest path algorithms. 
        We take the classic story of the Minotaur in the Knossos labryinth and uses that as the basis of a simple video game.
        The maze is made up of polygons that are pre-made or a custom maze made by the player.
        The player can then view the path made by the visibility graph and shortest path algorithms.
        The algorithm will prevent you from creating too many obstacles so there arenâ€™t 
        any solutions. </p>

    <h2 class="descriptor">How It Works:</h2>
    <p>
        A visibility graph works by taking two start points and the verticies of all polygons in the maze.
        Then for each vertice of each polygon, determine which other vertices are within a line of sight (not through another polygon),
        and create an edge between that vertex and the other one. This graph is later used with shortest path algorithms to determine the shortest path.
        We will be using A* and/or Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculations.
